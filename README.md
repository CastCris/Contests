Hello contestants and those aren't! Welcome to Contest git repository! Here you can find resolution for several popular open contests, as OBI for now. I hope that you, dear contestant, can get a bost in your learn, critical sense and kill your question through of this codes.

For a best stream of the code, I create the run file. It is a file wrote in shellscript language. You can quickly run any existing file able to compile typing:

./run --file=my_file.c

Any question type:

./run --help
